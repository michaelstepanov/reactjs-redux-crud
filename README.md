# React.js - Redux CRUD Application

The repository contains simple React.js - Redux CRUD application.  
The application uses fake test REST API service http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ as a data provider.  
Note: Requests and responses of the API are correct but data itself is not changed on the resource.  
So, the application's UI may ferlect not exactly as expected, for example, posts are not removed/updated.
